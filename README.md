# example_wiki_scripts
Example wiki one-off Python scripts using mwrogue

This repo will contain random scratches I write to accomplish tasks for Leaguepedia and my other wikis, but would otherwise not save. I realize these scripts are probably the most useful content for other people to see to learn how to write Python scripts, but I'm not going to save them in any of my normal repos, so I'm creating this repo to archive them. Hopefully it's useful!

See https://github.com/RheingoldRiver/mwcleric for installation and setup of my mwclient wrapper, which everything will depend on always.

If you find this repo useful, please consider [contributing your own example scripts](https://river.me/blog/send-me-scripts/) so that there are more examples for people to look at in the future!
