# example_wiki_scripts
Example wiki one-off Python scripts using river_mwclient

This repo will contain random scratches I write to accomplish tasks for Leaguepedia and my other wikis, but would otherwise not save. I realize these scripts are probably the most useful content for other people to see to learn how to write Python scripts, but I'm not going to save them in any of my normal repos, so I'm creating this repo to archive them. Hopefully it's useful!

See https://github.com/RheingoldRiver/mwcleric for installation and setup of my mwclient wrapper, which everything will depend on always.

For additional example code, see https://github.com/RheingoldRiver/leaguepedia_util and https://github.com/RheingoldRiver/leaguepedia_archive, though these repos will tend to contain significantly more complicated code on average.
